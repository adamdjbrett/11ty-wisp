Hi and welcome in to 11ty wisp project.

This 11ty port is maintained and developed by [Adam DJ Brett](https://adamdjbrett.com) to help you build a book site easily and quickly!!!
I admire not only Side Notes work but also Pico.css because of their simplicity, sidenotes, typography, and multiple types of images that can be used.

Clone / Fork this Project `git clone https://github.com/adamdjbrett/11ty-wisp.git`
